        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>One of hip-hop's most beloved anti-heroes, the ever-inventive MF Doom (often referred to as simply DOOM, in
            all
            caps) has received widespread praise for his sharp, candid rhymes as well as his choppy, sample-heavy
            production
            style.<br></p>
        <p>Initially known as Zev Love X, a member of the short-lived but influential Golden Age rap group K.M.D., the
            MC/producer born Daniel Dumile re-emerged at the end of the '90s with a persona and logo patterned after the
            Marvel Comics super villain Dr. Doom. He reinforced his enigmatic persona by donning an elaborate iron mask
            during
            all of his public appearances, in addition to occasionally hiring stand-ins for his performances.<br></p>
        <p>His discography is filled with numerous collaborations, instrumental albums, and works by alter egos, with
            only a
            handful of proper full-lengths credited to his most well-known moniker, and he's gone through highly
            prolific
            periods as well as lengthy absences. A heavily influential figure in underground hip-hop, Doom is best known
            to
            mainstream audiences through his collaborations with virtual pop group Gorillaz as well as exposure via
            Cartoon
            Network's Adult Swim programming block.<br></p>
